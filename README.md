# Determination - Sans-battle
A Python-powered Undertale-inspired Sans battle. Dodge bones, attack, and survive using a fully animated fight system with custom UI, sound effects, and multiple attack patterns. Built with Pygame. Still unfinished...

10/16/25 - Small animation fix / Added basic functionality to act,mercy(Skip turn) and heal(+50HP)
10/17/25 - Added really basic gaster blaster to the game. Still lacks a lot of stuff and got no animation.
